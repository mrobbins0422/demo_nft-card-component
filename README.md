## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since this was my first project using GIT and GitHub, I learned a lot about workflow using 
these systems. 

### Continued development

I am looking forward to the next challenge.

### Useful resources

- [How TO - Image Hover Overlay] (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me to create the hover background and to center an icon on top of an image..
